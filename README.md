## Featured Projects

### 1. Retail Sales & Profitability Analysis (Superstore Dataset 2025)

**Description**  
End-to-end analysis of a global superstore's sales data to uncover profitability drivers, identify underperforming segments, and provide actionable recommendations for assortment optimization and marketing focus.

**Tools Used**  
- Python (pandas for cleaning & analysis, matplotlib for interactive visuals)  
- SQL (complex joins, window functions, aggregation)  
- Power BI (interactive dashboard with slicers, drill-through, KPIs)

**Key Insights & Impact**  
- Top 20% of customers generate ~65% of profit, while bottom 30% are unprofitable due to high discounts and shipping costs.  
- Central region shows consistent negative profit margin (-12%) — recommend reducing promotional intensity there.  
- Technology category yields 2.3× higher profit per sale than Furniture — prioritize upselling tech products.  
- Seasonal peaks in Q4 contribute 35% of annual revenue — suggest early inventory planning and targeted Black Friday campaigns.

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis (Telco/Bank Dataset)

**Description**  
Comprehensive churn analysis to identify at-risk customers, understand root causes, and estimate potential savings from retention strategies.

**Tools Used**  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn for basic modeling, seaborn/plotly for visuals)  
- SQL (cohort analysis, retention curves)  
- Tableau (dynamic churn dashboard with risk scoring)

**Key Results & Business Value**  
- Churn rate: 26.5% — highest among month-to-month contracts and fiber optic users.  
- Top risk factors: low tenure (<12 months), high monthly charges (> $80), no tech support.  
- Predictive model achieves ~82% accuracy — early intervention on top 15% risk segment could reduce churn by 18–22%.  
- Estimated annual savings: ~$180,000–$250,000 (assuming average customer LTV $1,000).

### 3. E-commerce Performance & Marketing Funnel Dashboard (Brazilian E-Commerce / Ozon-style 2025)

**Description**  
Analysis of e-commerce sales funnel, customer journey, and marketing efficiency to optimize acquisition costs and increase repeat purchases.

**Tools Used**  
- Python (pandas for data wrangling, plotly for funnel viz)  
- SQL (funnel staging, cohort retention)  
- Power BI (ROAS tracking, channel performance, LTV/CAC dashboard)

**Key Insights & Recommendations**  
- Organic search drives 42% of traffic but only 28% of revenue — paid ads (Google + Meta) have 3.1× higher ROAS.  
- Repeat purchase rate: 18% — customers acquired via email campaigns show 2.4× higher LTV.  
- Average order value drops 22% on mobile devices — recommend mobile checkout optimization.  
- Projected revenue uplift: 14–19% by reallocating 15% of budget to high-LTV channels.
